-- As we've seen, a constructor in an algebraic data type can have several
-- (or none at all) fields and each field must be of some concrete type.
-- With that in mind, we can make types whose constructors have fields that
-- are of the same type! Using that, we can create recursive data types, where
-- one value of some type contains values of that type, which in turn contain
-- more values of the same type and so on.

But honestly, i dont understand a shit after this.
